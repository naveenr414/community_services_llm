      "1. Physical Exercise Goal\n",
      "• \n",
      "  Specific: Aim to get 30 minutes of moderate physical activity daily, such as walking around your neighborhood or using a community park in Morristown, NJ.  \n",
      "• \n",
      "  Measurable: Track your walks by noting start and end times or using a simple step counter app.  \n",
      "• \n",
      "  Achievable: Start with a pace that's comfortable for you, gradually increasing your activity as your stamina improves.  \n",
      "• \n",
      "  Realistic: Given your current living situation and being retired, a daily walk is a manageable activity that won’t require a major lifestyle change.  \n",
      "• \n",
      "  Timely: Begin immediately and commit to this routine for the next 4 weeks as a starting point. Reassess at the end of the month to consider increasing time or intensity.\n",
      "──────────────────────────────\n",
      "2. Nutrition and Diet Improvement Goal\n",
      "• \n",
      "  Specific: Improve your diet by incorporating at least 2 servings of fresh fruits or vegetables into your daily meals, and planning a weekly menu that emphasizes whole foods over processed options.  \n",
      "• \n",
      "  Measurable: Use a food diary or a simple calendar to mark off days when you meet your serving goal.  \n",
      "• \n",
      "  Achievable: Shopping at a local farmer’s market or community-supported agriculture program in Morristown can help you access fresh produce easily.  \n",
      "• \n",
      "  Realistic: Gradually adjusting your diet by adding small servings will allow you to comfortably transition without making drastic changes.  \n",
      "• \n",
      "  Timely: Set a goal to steadily implement your new diet over the next 6 weeks, with a weekly review of your food diary to measure progress and make needed adjustments.\n",
      "──────────────────────────────\n",
      "3. Social Connection Goal\n",
      "• \n",
      "  Specific: Build social connections by attending a community event, senior center activity, or exercise group at least once a week. Consider activities like group walks, local art classes, or social clubs available for seniors in Morristown.  \n",
      "• \n",
      "  Measurable: Keep a weekly log of events attended and note one new person you connect with at each event (or even just exchange contact info).  \n",
      "• \n",
      "  Achievable: Many community centers and local parks host regular events—calling ahead or visiting their websites can help you plan your participation.  \n",
      "• \n",
      "  Realistic: Allocating one afternoon or morning each week for a social activity is manageable and can be rewarding without overwhelming your schedule.  \n",
      "• \n",
      "  Timely: Commit to this routine for the next 3 months. After this period, reflect on how these new connections have impacted your daily mood and overall well-being, then decide whether to increase frequency or explore additional types of activities.\n",
      "──────────────────────────────\n",
      "Additional Tips:\n",
      "• Consider partnering with a local community resource or a wellness counselor who might help tailor these activities to your preferences and needs.  \n",
      "• If starting a new exercise routine feels challenging, consult a doctor or a physical therapist to ensure your plan suits your health status.  \n",
      "• Use a simple journal or an app to monitor both your physical and social activities to reinforce your progress and celebrate small wins.\n",
      "By following these goals, you’ll be taking balanced steps toward improved physical health and enhanced social connectivity—both key ingredients for overall well-being. Please feel free to ask for further guidance or adjustments along the way.\n"
